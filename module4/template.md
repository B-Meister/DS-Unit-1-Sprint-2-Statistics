# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

Video Games

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation - Used in almost all countries and across all demographics. Can rank areas that buy more games or game genres and their fan base. Cost of a game in each country vs the sales of a game


2. Trend related to the news - increase in amount of video games played during quarantine, large amount of people are moving to online game streams instead of physical sports


3. Who does that? - Anyone can play video games, mostly boys til the age of 30 


4. Answering a question people care about - What kind of video games sell most often? 


5. Valuable to businesses - Yes so they can see what games are hits and produce similar games or observe trends in game genres and their market.


6. What's the most popular? - Bar Graphs of titles with the most sales/revenue


7. Cost/Money rankings - Ratio of cost of game production/sales of game (ROI?)


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? - Video Games are for little boys OR Video games cause violence


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
The correlation between gender and age versus genre of games/sales of games is an interesting one for me. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Because there are lots of variable it would be easy to come up with many hypotheses because you can test an age group against a variety of genres. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Does the blue ocean (competition is irrelevant and make games that sell to everyone) or red ocean (compete for highest value clients - boys between the age of 12 and 30) strategy have a higher ROI?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
The wide variety of variables would let you mimic any style.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

Hyperpolarization of the American Party System / The monolith of the two party system

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation - Analyze states and their politican leanings over time


2. Trend related to the news - Dems/Reps blocking each others bill (can check the how they vote on opposite party bills)


3. Who does that? - Select population of The US House and Senate


4. Answering a question people care about - What is the average number of bills passed for each party?


5. Valuable to businesses - Which party passes more business related bills? 


6. What's the most popular?- Scatterplot with y axis = polarization (multiple graphs, 1 for each year)


7. Cost/Money rankings - how much money was used in each persons campaign 


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That elections are a fee choice to choose who ever you think is the most viable candidate. - In reality, it's the option between candidates from the party

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://www.vox.com/2015/4/23/8485443/polarization-congress-visualization - this graph on vox was a great form of data storytelling that opened my eyes to the real issue of hyper polarization

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
What is the chi^2 test for the polarization for each of the candidates (with being moderate= 0)

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
How much support do the other parties within congress receive from the population?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
How many counties have a third option that is not republican or democrat?
